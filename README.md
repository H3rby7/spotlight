# Autospot

Idea is to have a "Moving-Head" (a light) connected to a form of beacon. The light will always point to that beacon.

## Further

It may be possible to control more feature of the Moving-Head with an app or voice commands or gestures or whatever really

* I heard there is also a form of bluetooth ring that might do the trick.

# Technology

I researched a couple of possible technologies. Many of them are used in industry for highly automated production environments for position/location/direction finding.

TLDR: My first try will be [bluetooth 5.1 with "Angle of Arrival (AoA)"](https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/new-aoa-aod-bluetooth-capabilities/) 
with the [nRF52811 chip](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52811/GetStarted).
I do not work for nordic or anything ;)

# Approach

## NExt

- [ ] Wire nRF52811 to Arduino Board
    - [ ] [Hardware wiring](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fug_nrf52840_dk%2FUG%2Fcommon%2Fnordic_tools.html)
        - [ ] Antenna Array
    - [ ] Check for bluetooth to work (How is to be determined)
- [ ] A beacon sending a constant signal, received by arduino
- [ ] Setup AoA mode for nRF52811 
- [ ] Receive IQ data (basically the raw data) and dump to CSV
- [ ] Visualize IQ data in excel or something
- [ ] Interpret Data / Use one of the AoA algorithms

# Setup

(hypothetical, right now I do not know what is necessary)

https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fug_nrf52840_dk%2FUG%2Fcommon%2Fnordic_tools.html

* GNU/GCC as we are programming C something
