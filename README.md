# Autospot

Idea is to have a "Moving-Head" (a light) connected to a form of beacon. The light will always point to that beacon.

## Further

It may be possible to control more feature of the Moving-Head with an app or voice commands or gestures or whatever really

* I heard there is also a form of bluetooth ring that might do the trick.

# Technology

* For angling, see [angle of arrival](aiming/README.md)

# Approach

- [ ] Find the right direction to shine (Angle of Arrival, BT 5.1) -
**postponed, the part I wanted to use is way too small to be connected by a newbie like me. (6mm<sup>2</sup>...)**
- [ ] Speak to a Moving-Head via REST using DMX
