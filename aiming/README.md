# Technology

I researched a couple of possible technologies. Many of them are used in industry for highly automated production environments for position/location/direction finding.

See [Research](research/README.md)

## Next Steps

- Find a suitable Kit/Board to attempt AOA with UWB
- Maybe work on the REST -> DMX (spotlight) part first.

## Implementation

- Attempted [Bluetooth](./bluetooth/README.md)
- Attempting [UltraWideBand](./uwb/README.md)
