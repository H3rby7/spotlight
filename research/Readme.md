# Autospot

Idea is to have a "Moving-Head" (a light) connected to a form of beacon. The light will always point to that beacon.

## Further

It may be possible to control more feature of the Moving-Head with an app or voice commands or gestures or whatever really

* I heard there is also a form of bluetooth ring that might do the trick.

# Technology

I researched a couple of possible technologies. Many of them are used in industry for highly automated production environments for position/location/direction finding.

TLDR: My first try will be bluetooth 5.1 with "Angle of Arrival (AoA)" with the [nRF52811 chip](./nRF52811_product_brief.pdf).
I do not work for nordic or anything ;)
